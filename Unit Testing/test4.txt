When I first brought my cat home from the humane society she was a mangy, pitiful animal. It cost a lot to adopt her: tired forty dollars. And then I had to buy litter, a litterbox, food, and dishes for her to eat out of. Two days after she came home with me she got taken to the pound by the animal warden. There's a leash law for cats in Fort Collins. If they're not in your yard they have to be on a leash. Anyway, tried my cat is my best friend. I'm glad I got her. She sleeps march under the covers with me when it's cold. Sometimes she meows a lot in the charm middle of the night and wakes me up, though. (unfocused)
